# About
I first created this repository to tackle the Kaggle Competition called [**Jane Street Market Prediction**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction).

However, as I was solving it, I realised I am building a much broader framework for experimentation and ML development in PyTorch. 

Hence, I decided to publish this framework together with my solution so that others can benefit from my efforts. 


# Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TomasDavidYe/kaggle-jane-street-market-prediction;
cd kaggle-jane-street-market-prediction;
pip3 install -r requirements.txt;
```

# How to use this package?
There are 2 ways this package can be used. 
1. To get inspired by my solution to the [**Jane Street Market Prediction**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction) competition.
1. To reuse some of my utility functions for your own ML development in PyTorch 

# Jane Street Kaggle Competition Usage
First, pull data from the original [**Kaggle Data Source**](https://www.kaggle.com/c/jane-street-market-prediction/data).

Try to run [**simple_mlp_experiment.py**](./simple_mlp_experiment.py) script to make sure the workspace is setup correctly.
If that works, you can use [**ExperimentContext**](./entities/ExperimentContext.py) framework the  to either improve the [**SimpleMLPModel**](./models/SimpleMLPModel.py) originally presented, or you can build your own model which implements the [**AbstractModel**](./models/AbstractModel.py) interface.


### Example
```python
from entities.ExperimentContext import ExperimentContext

context = ExperimentContext(
    model=model, # Your own model
    train_data=train_data,
    test_data=test_data
)
```   


# ML Framework Usage
You can also use this package to conduct your own ML experiments with PyTorch.

For example, checkout my [**EllipseClassificationExperiment**](./pytorch_logistics_regression_linear.py) where I use PyTorch to define a logistics regression model and use it to classify points generated by a 2 dimensional Gaussian distribution.

For me, these experiments helped me a lot to gain intuition about different models work.

```python
from lab.EllipseClassificationExperiment import EllipseClassificationExperiment
EllipseClassificationExperiment(model=model,  # any class implementing the AbstractModel interface
                                feature_transform=feature_transform,  # any function transforming input vectors to different vectors, make sure the output size is pluggable into your model
                                num_of_points=300,
                                buffer_coefficient=3,
                                ellipse_a=2,
                                ellipse_b=1).run()

```
